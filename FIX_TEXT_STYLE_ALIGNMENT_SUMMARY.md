# Fix: Text Style and Alignment Issue

## Problem Description

The issue was reported that text styles (normal, bold, italic, bold italic) and alignments (left, center, right) were not being applied correctly when using fonts that only have a single variant (typically 'normal').

### Original Issue
When using a font like Pacifico that only has a "normal" (Regular) variant:
- Requesting `style: 'bold'` would not make the text bold
- Requesting `style: 'italic'` would not make the text italic
- Requesting `style: 'bold italic'` would not apply either effect

This was because the code would fall back to the 'normal' font file but wouldn't apply any synthetic styling effects.

## Solution

The fix implements **synthetic text styling** for fonts that don't have dedicated style variants:

### 1. Bold Effect (Synthetic)
- Uses PIL's `stroke_width` parameter in `ImageDraw.text()`
- Calculates stroke width as `font_size / 20` for proportional scaling
- Applied to text fill color to create a thicker appearance
- Works for both horizontal and vertical text

### 2. Italic Effect (Synthetic)
- Uses OpenCV's `cv2.warpAffine()` with shear transformation
- Applies a -15 degree shear angle (configurable constant)
- Creates a slanted/italic appearance
- Handles edge cases with proper padding

### 3. Style Tracking
- Tracks which font style was actually loaded vs. requested
- Determines when synthetic styling is needed
- Applies effects only when the loaded style doesn't match the requested style

## Implementation Details

### Key Changes in `whiteboard_animator.py`

1. **Added Constants** (lines 112-113):
   ```python
   SYNTHETIC_BOLD_STROKE_DIVISOR = 20
   SYNTHETIC_ITALIC_SHEAR_ANGLE = -15
   ```

2. **Helper Function** (lines 288-297):
   ```python
   def calculate_synthetic_bold_stroke(font_size):
       """Calculate stroke width for synthetic bold effect."""
       stroke_width = max(1, int(font_size / SYNTHETIC_BOLD_STROKE_DIVISOR))
       return stroke_width
   ```

3. **Style Tracking** (lines 421-426):
   - Added `synthetic_bold`, `synthetic_italic`, and `loaded_style` variables
   - Track which style variant is actually loaded

4. **Synthetic Bold Application** (lines 584-589, 599-604):
   - Applied to both vertical and horizontal text
   - Uses `stroke_width` and `stroke_fill` parameters

5. **Synthetic Italic Application** (lines 633-671):
   - Applies shear transformation after text is drawn
   - Handles edge cases with proper cropping and padding

6. **Vertical Text Effects** (lines 591-613):
   - Completed implementation of shadow and outline for vertical text
   - Applied synthetic bold to all text drawing operations

## Testing

### Test Files Created
1. `test_style_align_bug.py` - Basic functional tests
2. `test_issue_example.py` - Tests with exact configuration from issue
3. `test_visual_styles.py` - Creates visual comparison images
4. `demo_style_fix.py` - Visual demonstration of the fix

### Test Results
- ✅ All 8 basic tests pass
- ✅ All style variants render correctly (normal, bold, italic, bold italic)
- ✅ All alignments work correctly (left, center, right)
- ✅ Existing tests continue to pass (no regression)
- ✅ CodeQL security scan: 0 alerts

## Visual Results

The fix produces visibly different text for each style:
- **Normal**: Standard font rendering
- **Bold**: Thicker text with stroke effect
- **Italic**: Slanted text at 15-degree angle
- **Bold Italic**: Combined effects

Alignment also works correctly:
- **Left**: Text starts from left margin
- **Center**: Text centered horizontally
- **Right**: Text aligned to right margin

## Configuration Example

```json
{
  "text_config": {
    "text": "Your text here",
    "font": "Pacifico",
    "size": 37,
    "style": "bold italic",  // Now works even though Pacifico has no bold/italic variant
    "color": [0, 0, 0],
    "align": "center"        // Works as expected
  }
}
```

## Backwards Compatibility

✅ The fix is **fully backwards compatible**:
- Fonts with dedicated style variants continue to use them
- Synthetic styling only applies when needed
- No changes required to existing configurations
- All existing tests pass without modification

## Performance Impact

⚡ **Minimal performance impact**:
- Bold effect: Only adds stroke parameter to existing text drawing
- Italic effect: Single affine transformation per text layer
- Both effects are applied efficiently using numpy/OpenCV operations

## Code Quality

✅ **Addressed all code review feedback**:
- Fixed indentation consistency
- Extracted duplicated logic into helper function
- Added named constants for magic numbers
- Fixed potential array bounds issues
- Completed incomplete code sections

✅ **Security**:
- No security vulnerabilities found by CodeQL
- No sensitive data handling
- No external dependencies added

## Summary

This fix resolves the reported issue where text styles and alignments were not applied correctly for fonts without style variants. The solution uses synthetic styling techniques (stroke for bold, shear for italic) to provide the expected visual effects while maintaining full backwards compatibility and minimal performance impact.

**Issue Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**
