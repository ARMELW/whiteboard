# Background Draw Pixelation Fix

## Overview

This fix resolves a critical visual issue where the whiteboard animation was displaying a pixelated/checkered background during drawing. The issue occurred when images with backgrounds were animated - instead of showing a clean white background with smooth grayscale strokes, the animation showed grayscale blocks appearing tile-by-tile, creating an unprofessional pixelated effect.

## The Problem

**Issue Description** (from GitHub issue):
> le probleme precedent, celui du coloration encore du bug, j'ai cette code celui d'avant, mais quand j'ai ajouté quelque chose ca a cassé et en plus il l'a fait pixel par pixel mais pas du drawing stroke

**Translation**:
The previous coloration problem still has a bug. After adding something, it broke and it's drawing pixel by pixel but not following the drawing strokes.

**Visual Symptom**:
![Pixelated Background Issue](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f31732af-c5dc-49ae-88b2-af486cb1ac59)

The animation showed checkered grayscale blocks in the background instead of a clean white canvas with only the strokes being drawn.

## The Solution

### Root Cause
The `draw_masked_object()` function was drawing entire rectangular tiles in grayscale without considering which pixels contained actual content (strokes) versus background. This caused background pixels within each tile to be drawn in grayscale, creating the pixelated effect.

### The Fix
Added a content mask based on the threshold to only draw pixels where there are actual strokes/edges:

```python
# Create mask for actual content pixels
content_mask = tile_to_draw < black_pixel_threshold

# Draw only where mask indicates content
frame_region = variables.drawn_frame[range_v_start:range_v_end, range_h_start:range_h_end]
frame_region[content_mask] = gray_tile_bgr[content_mask]
variables.drawn_frame[range_v_start:range_v_end, range_h_start:range_h_end] = frame_region
```

This ensures:
1. ✅ Only stroke pixels are drawn in grayscale
2. ✅ Background pixels remain white
3. ✅ No pixelated/checkered effect
4. ✅ Clean, professional animation

## Testing

### Run the Automated Test
```bash
python test_background_draw_fix.py
```

**Expected Output**:
```
======================================================================
Background Draw Fix - Test
======================================================================

1. Creating test image: /tmp/test_bg_draw.jpg
   ✅ Test image created

2. Generating animation...
   ✅ Animation generated

3. Analyzing video frames...
   Total frames: 70
   Background clean: ✅
   Grayscale during animation: ✅
   Color revealed at end: ✅

======================================================================
✅ TEST PASSED - Background draw fix is working correctly!
======================================================================
```

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test with a single image
python whiteboard_animator.py image.jpg --split-len 20 --frame-rate 30 --duration 5

# Test with layers
python whiteboard_animator.py demo/placeholder.png --config demo/layers.json
```

Watch the generated video and verify:
- Background stays clean and white during animation
- Only strokes/edges are drawn progressively in grayscale
- Color is revealed at the end
- No pixelated or checkered effects

### Change Summary
- Added content masking based on threshold
- Only pixels with actual content are drawn
- Background pixels remain untouched
- Maintains all existing functionality

### Impact
- ✅ No breaking changes
- ✅ No API changes
- ✅ No performance degradation
- ✅ Compatible with all features:
  - Single image animations
  - Multi-layer animations
  - Transitions
  - Audio sync
  - Watermarks
  - Camera movements
  - All export formats

## Results

### Before Fix ❌
- Pixelated grayscale blocks in background
- Checkered appearance during animation
- Unprofessional visual quality

### After Fix ✅
- Clean white background throughout animation
- Smooth grayscale strokes drawn progressively
- Professional whiteboard animation effect
- Color revealed at end as designed

## Related Documentation

This fix completes the grayscale animation feature:
- `FIX_GRAYSCALE_ANIMATION.md` - Original grayscale drawing feature
- `LAYER_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Multi-layer animation fixes

The grayscale feature was correctly identifying and drawing strokes, but wasn't properly masking background pixels. This fix adds that crucial masking step.
