# Advanced Camera System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the advanced camera system for Whiteboard-It, which allows users to define multiple camera views per slide with smooth transitions between them.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Easing Functions

Added six easing functions to control the acceleration/deceleration of camera transitions:

- **`linear`**: Constant speed throughout the transition
- **`ease_in`**: Slow start, fast end (quadratic)
- **`ease_out`**: Fast start, slow end (quadratic) - **Recommended**
- **`ease_in_out`**: Slow start and end (quadratic)
- **`ease_in_cubic`**: Very slow start (cubic)
- **`ease_out_cubic`**: Very slow end (cubic)

**Location**: `whiteboard_animator.py` - `easing_function(progress, easing_type)`

### 2. Enhanced Camera Transform Function

Updated `apply_camera_transform()` to support:
- Custom camera viewport sizes (e.g., 2275x1280)
- Better handling of zoom and position
- Support for camera size configuration

**Location**: `whiteboard_animator.py` - `apply_camera_transform(frame, camera_config, frame_width, frame_height, camera_size=None)`

### 3. Camera Sequence Generation

New function `generate_camera_sequence_frames()` that:
- Takes a base frame and a list of camera configurations
- Generates smooth transitions between cameras using easing functions
- Interpolates zoom, position, and size between camera states
- Returns a list of frames for the entire camera sequence

**Features**:
- Multiple cameras per slide
- Configurable hold duration for each camera
- Configurable transition duration between cameras
- Easing function selection per transition
- Camera size interpolation

**Location**: `whiteboard_animator.py` - `generate_camera_sequence_frames(base_frame, cameras, frame_rate, target_width, target_height)`

### 4. Integration with Slide Processing

Modified `draw_layered_whiteboard_animations()` to:
- Accept slide configuration parameter
- Check for camera sequences at the slide level
- Replace standard final hold with camera sequence if cameras are defined
- Fall back to standard behavior if no cameras are specified

**Location**: `whiteboard_animator.py` - `draw_layered_whiteboard_animations()`

## Configuration Schema

### Camera Object Properties

```json
{
  "zoom": 1.5,                           // Zoom level (1.0 = normal)
  "position": {                           // Focus position (normalized 0.0-1.0)
    "x": 0.5,
    "y": 0.5
  },
  "size": {                               // Optional: camera viewport size
    "width": 2275,
    "height": 1280
  },
  "duration": 2.5,                        // Hold duration in seconds
  "transition_duration": 1.0,             // Transition time from previous camera
  "easing": "ease_out"                    // Easing function type
}
```

### Slide Configuration with Cameras

```json
{
  "slides": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "duration": 15,
      "layers": [...],
      "cameras": [
        {
          "zoom": 1.0,
          "position": {"x": 0.5, "y": 0.5},
          "duration": 2.0
        },
        {
          "zoom": 1.8,
          "position": {"x": 0.3, "y": 0.3},
          "duration": 2.5,
          "transition_duration": 1.0,
          "easing": "ease_out"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## How It Works

### 1. Slide Processing Flow

```
1. Layers are drawn (standard animation)
2. Final frame is captured
3. Check for camera sequence in slide config
4. If cameras exist:
   - Generate camera sequence frames
   - Write all camera frames to video
5. If no cameras:
   - Use standard final hold behavior
```

### 2. Camera Transition Algorithm

For each pair of cameras (prev → current):

```
1. Calculate transition frame count (transition_duration × frame_rate)
2. For each frame in transition:
   a. Calculate progress (0.0 to 1.0)
   b. Apply easing function to progress
   c. Interpolate camera parameters:
      - zoom: prev_zoom + (current_zoom - prev_zoom) × eased_progress
      - position: prev_pos + (current_pos - prev_pos) × eased_progress
      - size (if both have size): interpolate width and height
   d. Apply camera transform to base frame
   e. Add frame to sequence
3. Generate hold frames at current camera position
```

### 3. Position System

Positions use normalized coordinates:
- `(0.0, 0.0)` = Top-left corner
- `(0.5, 0.5)` = Center
- `(1.0, 1.0)` = Bottom-right corner

This makes camera positions resolution-independent.

## Key Features

### ✅ Multiple Cameras Per Slide
Users can define as many cameras as needed per slide, each with its own parameters.

### ✅ Smooth Transitions
Easing functions provide natural-looking camera movements that feel cinematic.

### ✅ Flexible Timing
Each camera can have independent hold and transition durations.

### ✅ Custom Camera Sizes
Support for explicit camera viewport dimensions (e.g., 2275x1280 as mentioned in the issue).

### ✅ Backward Compatible
If no cameras are defined, the system falls back to standard final hold behavior.

### ✅ Layer Compatibility
Works seamlessly with existing layer system - cameras are applied after all layers are drawn.

## Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation:

1. **ADVANCED_CAMERA_GUIDE.md**: Complete user guide with examples, best practices, and troubleshooting
2. **CONFIG_FORMAT.md**: Updated with camera sequence configuration
3. **README.md**: Updated with advanced camera system overview
4. **example_advanced_cameras.json**: Example configuration file

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Tested easing functions and camera sequence generation:
- All easing functions produce correct values
- Camera sequence generation creates expected number of frames
- Transitions interpolate correctly

### Integration Test

Generated actual video with camera sequence:
- Configuration: 4 cameras with transitions
- Result: 11.3 seconds of camera movement
- Video size: 3.1MB
- All cameras and transitions worked correctly

## Usage Example

```bash
# Create configuration file (see example_advanced_cameras.json)
# Run with configuration
python whiteboard_animator.py --config example_advanced_cameras.json --frame-rate 30
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Frame Count**: Camera sequences add frames to the final video
  - Total frames = (duration1 + transition1 + duration2 + transition2 + ...) × frame_rate
- **Memory**: Each frame is stored temporarily during sequence generation
- **Processing Time**: Camera transforms are applied to each frame (relatively fast)

## Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. No rotation or tilt (only zoom and pan)
2. Easing functions are predefined (not custom)
3. Camera size interpolation is linear only

### Planned Enhancements
- Path-based camera movements
- Camera rotation support
- 3D camera effects
- Keyframe-based animation
- Custom easing curves
