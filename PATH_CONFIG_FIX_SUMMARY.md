# Path Config Format Fix Summary

## Issue Description

The user reported that `path_follow` mode was not working correctly when using the array format for `path_config`. 

**User's Configuration (from issue):**
```json
{
  "mode": "path_follow",
  "image_path": "doodle/arrow.png",
  "path_config": [
    {"x": 313, "y": 162},
    {"x": 191, "y": 165},
    {"x": 107, "y": 166},
    ...
  ]
}
```

**Problem:** The code only recognized the object format `{"points": [...]}` and would fall back to extracting path points from the image when given an array directly.

## Root Cause

In `whiteboard_animator.py`, the `draw_path_follow` function at line 3367 checked:
```python
if path_config and 'points' in path_config:
```

This check would fail when `path_config` is a list/array instead of a dictionary, causing the code to fall back to image-based path extraction.

## Solution

Modified the `draw_path_follow` function to support both formats:

1. **Array format (Direct):** `[{"x": 1, "y": 2}, ...]`
2. **Object format (With points key):** `{"points": [{"x": 1, "y": 2}, ...]}`

### Code Changes

**Before:**
```python
if path_config and 'points' in path_config:
    # Convert config points to list of tuples
    path_points = [(p['x'], p['y']) for p in path_config['points']]
else:
    # Extract from image
```

**After:**
```python
if path_config:
    # Support both formats: array directly or object with 'points' key
    if isinstance(path_config, list):
        # Direct array format: [{"x": 1, "y": 2}, ...]
        path_points = [(p['x'], p['y']) for p in path_config]
    elif isinstance(path_config, dict) and 'points' in path_config:
        # Object format: {"points": [{"x": 1, "y": 2}, ...]}
        path_points = [(p['x'], p['y']) for p in path_config['points']]
    else:
        # Invalid format, fall through to image extraction
        path_config = None

if not path_config:
    # Extract from image
```

## Testing

Created comprehensive tests to verify both formats work:

1. **test_path_config_formats.py** - Basic unit tests for format detection
2. **test_path_config_both_formats.py** - Comprehensive tests with real-world examples

All tests pass successfully ✅

## Documentation Updates

Updated `PATH_FOLLOW_GUIDE.md` to document both supported formats:
- Added examples showing both array and object formats
- Clarified that both formats are equivalent and supported
- Provided use cases for each format

## Affected Files

- `whiteboard_animator.py` - Core fix in `draw_path_follow` function
- `PATH_FOLLOW_GUIDE.md` - Documentation update
- `test_path_config_formats.py` - Basic unit test (new)
- `test_path_config_both_formats.py` - Comprehensive test (new)

## Backward Compatibility

✅ Fully backward compatible
- Existing configurations using `{"points": [...]}` format continue to work
- New configurations can use the simpler array format `[...]`

## Examples

Both of these configurations now work identically:

**Format 1 (Object with points):**
```json
{
  "path_config": {
    "points": [
      {"x": 100, "y": 100},
      {"x": 200, "y": 200}
    ]
  }
}
```

**Format 2 (Direct array - simpler):**
```json
{
  "path_config": [
    {"x": 100, "y": 100},
    {"x": 200, "y": 200}
  ]
}
```

## Resolution

✅ Issue resolved
- Both array and object formats are now supported
- User's configuration from the issue now works correctly
- Comprehensive tests ensure the fix works as expected
- Documentation updated to reflect both supported formats
