# Scene Cameras Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement

When exporting videos from scene configurations, elements were not positioned correctly according to their specified coordinates. Elements appeared centered and misplaced instead of being at their configured positions.

### Original Issue (French)
> "en faite toutes est centre je l'impression que tous ne pas positionnerr au bon endroit, je pense que la construction du scenes ne pas bien fiaite"

Translation: Everything is centered, elements are not positioned in the right place, scene construction is not done properly.

## Root Cause

The scene configuration used `sceneCameras` field to define camera views, but the code only recognized `cameras` field at the slide level. This meant:
1. Camera configurations in `sceneCameras` were ignored
2. Default camera behavior was applied instead
3. Elements appeared incorrectly positioned in the exported video

## Solution

Implemented automatic mapping of `sceneCameras` to `cameras` with the following logic:

### 1. Single Scene Config Support
When a configuration has `layers` at the root level (no `slides` wrapper):
```python
# Before: Config with layers but no slides wrapper was not supported
{
    "layers": [...],
    "sceneCameras": [...]
}

# After: Automatically wrapped into slides structure
{
    "slides": [{
        "layers": [...],
        "cameras": [...]  # Mapped from sceneCameras
    }]
}
```

### 2. sceneCameras Mapping
The mapping happens in two places:

**A. At config loading time** (for single scene configs):
```python
if 'layers' in per_slide_config and 'slides' not in per_slide_config:
    # Wrap into slides structure
    per_slide_config = {
        'slides': [per_slide_config],
        'canvas_width': per_slide_config.get('canvas_width', 1920),
        'canvas_height': per_slide_config.get('canvas_height', 1080)
    }
    # Map sceneCameras to cameras
    if 'sceneCameras' in per_slide_config['slides'][0]:
        if 'cameras' not in per_slide_config['slides'][0] or not per_slide_config['slides'][0]['cameras']:
            per_slide_config['slides'][0]['cameras'] = per_slide_config['slides'][0]['sceneCameras']
```

**B. At slide processing time** (for slides within slides array):
```python
# Map sceneCameras to cameras if present (for compatibility)
if 'sceneCameras' in slide_config:
    if 'cameras' not in slide_config or not slide_config['cameras']:
        slide_config['cameras'] = slide_config['sceneCameras']
```

### 3. Priority Handling

The mapping respects the following priority:
1. **Non-empty `cameras` array**: Takes precedence, `sceneCameras` ignored
2. **Empty `cameras` array**: Replaced with `sceneCameras`
3. **No `cameras` field**: `sceneCameras` mapped to `cameras`

This ensures backward compatibility with existing configurations while supporting the new `sceneCameras` field.

## Testing

### Test Coverage

✅ **Scenario 1**: Single scene with sceneCameras and empty cameras array
```json
{
    "layers": [...],
    "cameras": [],
    "sceneCameras": [...]
}
```
Result: sceneCameras mapped to cameras ✓

✅ **Scenario 2**: Scene with both cameras and sceneCameras (cameras takes priority)
```json
{
    "layers": [...],
    "cameras": [{...}],
    "sceneCameras": [{...}]
}
```
Result: cameras used, sceneCameras ignored ✓

✅ **Scenario 3**: Scene with only sceneCameras
```json
{
    "layers": [...],
    "sceneCameras": [...]
}
```
Result: sceneCameras mapped to cameras ✓

✅ **Scenario 4**: Standard slides with cameras (backward compatibility)
```json
{
    "slides": [{
        "layers": [...],
        "cameras": [...]
    }]
}
```
Result: Works as before ✓

### Test Results

- All existing tests pass ✓
- New tests verify all mapping scenarios ✓
- Demo generates video successfully ✓
- Original scene data from issue works correctly ✓
- Code review feedback addressed ✓
- Security scan passed (0 issues) ✓

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Basic Scene with sceneCameras

```json
{
    "title": "My Scene",
    "canvas_width": 1920,
    "canvas_height": 1080,
    "layers": [
        {
            "type": "text",
            "position": {"x": 960, "y": 540},
            "text_config": {
                "text": "Hello World",
                "font": "Arial",
                "size": 48
            }
        }
    ],
    "sceneCameras": [
        {
            "position": {"x": 0.5, "y": 0.5},
            "zoom": 0.8,
            "duration": 3
        }
    ]
}
```

### Example 2: Multiple Camera Movements

```json
{
    "layers": [...],
    "sceneCameras": [
        {
            "name": "Wide View",
            "position": {"x": 0.5, "y": 0.5},
            "zoom": 0.7,
            "duration": 2
        },
        {
            "name": "Zoom In",
            "position": {"x": 0.5, "y": 0.5},
            "zoom": 1.5,
            "duration": 3,
            "transition_duration": 1,
            "easing": "ease_in_out"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Running the Demo

```bash
# Generate demo configuration
python3 demo_scene_cameras.py

# Generate video from demo
python3 whiteboard_animator.py --config demo_scene_cameras_config.json --frame-rate 30 --skip-rate 20
```

## Technical Details

### Camera Position System

- **Layer positions**: Absolute pixel coordinates (e.g., x: 960, y: 540)
- **Camera positions**: Relative coordinates 0.0-1.0 (e.g., x: 0.5, y: 0.5 = center)
- **Canvas**: Defined by canvas_width and canvas_height (default 1920x1080)
- **Zoom**: 1.0 = normal, <1.0 = zoom out, >1.0 = zoom in

### Camera Properties

| Property | Type | Description | Default |
|----------|------|-------------|---------|
| `position` | object | {x: 0.0-1.0, y: 0.0-1.0} | {x: 0.5, y: 0.5} |
| `zoom` | float | Zoom level | 1.0 |
| `duration` | float | Hold duration in seconds | 2.0 |
| `transition_duration` | float | Transition time in seconds | 0 |
| `easing` | string | Easing function | "ease_out" |
| `width` | int | Viewport width in pixels | Calculated |
| `height` | int | Viewport height in pixels | Calculated |

## Backward Compatibility

The implementation maintains full backward compatibility:

1. ✅ Existing configs with `cameras` field work unchanged
2. ✅ Configs without camera fields work as before
3. ✅ Standard slides structure remains supported
4. ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Future Considerations

Potential enhancements for future versions:

1. **Deprecation Warning**: Add a warning when `sceneCameras` is used, suggesting migration to `cameras`
2. **Validation**: Add validation to ensure camera positions are within 0.0-1.0 range
3. **Documentation**: Add inline documentation about camera coordinate systems
4. **Migration Tool**: Create a tool to automatically convert old configs to new format

## Conclusion

This fix resolves the scene positioning issue by:
- ✅ Recognizing and processing `sceneCameras` field
- ✅ Maintaining backward compatibility
- ✅ Providing clear priority rules
- ✅ Including comprehensive tests
- ✅ Providing usage examples

The implementation is minimal, focused, and well-tested, ensuring that scene elements are now positioned correctly according to their configuration.
